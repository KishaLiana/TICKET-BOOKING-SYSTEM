# The History of Software
Software refers to the interface between users and computer systems (hardware). It comprises of the programming instructions and data that tell the computer hardware how to perform various tasks.

The first software known as the SSEM (Small Scale Experimental Machine) was written in 1948. this was followed by tShe different computing eras like The Personal Computing Era in the 70s and 80s, and the Mobile device Era in the 90s.

Computing has seen a great deal of technological progress. The hardware upgrades would be meaningless without the birth and growth of software development. Ever other time you use a computer, you interact with software, from operating systems and spreadsheets to mobile apps and games.

# Software refers to the set of instructions in the form of programs that command the computer system and process the hardware components. These instructions can be used to create a software product following the software process.
The Software Process Models can collectively be defined as an extrapolation from the overall process being described. It is a simplified representation of a software process with every model representing the process from a specific perspective. Software Process Models include the following:
1.	The Workflow Model which refers to the ordered series of tasks and decisions that make up a business process or in this case the software development process.
2.	The Role/Action Model (RAM) is a type of software process model that depicts the roles of individuals involved in the process and specifies the activities of each delegate.
3.	The Data Flow Model: A diagrammatic enactment of the flow and exchange of data collected and information within the system.
4.	The Waterfall Model, also sequential in nature, is a design process model in which progression is illustrated as flowing steadily downward. 

**The waterfall model involves the following phases:**
i.	Requirements Specification  
ii.	System Design
iii.	Impementation
iv.	Testing.

The waterfall model is a software engineering model of two types i.e. The Classical Waterfall Model and the Iterative waterfall model
o	The classical waterfall model is simple but idealistic and is the most popular software model as other models are based off it. This software process model divides the software lifecycle into a set of consecutive phases as described in the image below: INSERT IMG TAG

# Advantages of the classical waterfall model
- it’s simple and easy to understand
- phases of the classical waterfall model are processed one at a time.
- every stage is clearly defined
- processes and activities are well documented
- uses a clear milestone structure which improves productivity.

# Disadvantages of the classical waterfall model.
- no feedback path as it assumes that no errors occur at previous stages
- with this model, it difficult to contain change requests since there is an assumption that all consumer requirements are constant which is an impossible construct in real life because customers usually change as the project progresses
- no overlapping of phases is time consuming and ultimately the project takes longer to complete.

o	The Iterative Waterfall Model incorporates the necessary changes that improve the classical waterfall model. It provides feedback paths from each phase to its preceding phases.

# Advantages of the Iterative Waterfall Model
- the iterative model offers a feedback mechanism from each phase allowing the developers to correct errors during the development process and these errors are shown in the latter phases.
- this model is simple and thus eases use.
- the iterative model is cost-effective especially when making changes to the plan or requirements.
- this model is coordinated and organized and therefore less time is consumed during documentation and design.

# Disadvantages of the Iterative Waterfall Model
- Risk handling is not supported
- Limits interaction with customers
- Incremental delivery of a minimum viable product is not supported

5.	The Evolutionary development Model follows the activities:
•	Specification
•	Development
•	Validation

6.	The Agile Development Model refers to a group of development processes which share characteristics but have some understated differences among themselves. Examples of SDLC Agile models include: Crystal, A tern, Feature-driven development, Scrum, Lean Development, Unified Process and Extreme Programming (XP).
In this model, the requirements are itemized into small parts which are incrementally developed following the SDLC and it adopts iterative development. The steps include:
•	Requirement gathering
•	Requirement analysis
•	Design
•	Coding
•	Unit testing
•	Acceptance testing

# Advantages of the Agile model
- When compared to programmers working alone, pair programming produces well-written, compact programs with fewer errors.
- After each iteration, customer service personnel get an understanding of upgraded software products. As a result, he can easily adjust any need if necessary.
- this model minimizes the overall development time of the project.

# Disadvantages of the Agile model
- When the project is completed and the developers are assigned to another project, maintenance of the established project may become an issue due to a lack of sufficient documentation.
- Due to the sheer lack of formal records, there is misunderstanding, and crucial decisions made during various phases can be misconstrued at any point by different team members.
